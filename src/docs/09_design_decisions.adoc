== Design Decisions


This section will be to specify some of the design decisions of the project. Some of them are:
 - The documentation will be done with asciidoctor, is opne source and is usefull.
 - The interface will be build with React and we will search some libraries to help us to do it more usable.
 - The code of the application will be Javascript.
 - The architecture will be Peer-to-Peer because is the better in a Solid decentraliced app.
 - The store of the data will be in Solid Pods so we won't need any database, the routes and the images will be stored there.
 - The maps used in the application will be generated with leafletjs because is free and is a good option.
