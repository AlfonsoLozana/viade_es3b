== Deployment View

The application can be executed in any of the main browsers. For this you need a computer
with internet connection and a SOLID POD, where the route data is stored. In this way, you can access
to the application from anywhere, as long as you have a computer and internet connection.
Depending on the course in the development of the application, an attempt will be made to adapt the application for mobile devices.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

The infractructure of the application is formed by 3 nodes. The user is connected to the first node which is the computer of the user, the user opens his browser that is necessary
to connect to the application. This browser which is the first node is connected to the Viade Application through GitHub Pages where is our application deployed. Then
the application is connected to the last node which is formed by 2 things, the first represents our POD, and the second represents another POD. We have to communicate to 
our POD, the other POD or both to use the application. For the moment, this is what we have done and this is the infrastructure of the application.
Our system only needs a computer with internet and a SOLID account, this is the infractrusture possible for all the scenarios, if we do something like adapt it to mobile
devices we can add another infrastructure.
