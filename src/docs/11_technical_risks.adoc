== Risks and Technical Debts

In this part of the documentation we will write about some risks and technical debts we will face in the development of this project.

|===
|Risk |Explanation
|Technologies |All the technologies we have to use in the application are news to us, so is a risk working with all of these applications and technologies.
|Teamates |Working with so much people in a team without knowing each others is a risk in the development of the application.
|Time |We have to do other subjects this semester, and this can become a problem for the development of this application. 
|Language | Using another lenguage in the applicaton is hard when you are not used to use it.
|Spec | Is hard to negotiate with other teams or people for the standarization of the store of the rutes in the PODs.
|Load Time| The load time of the application is elevated right now and we want to reduce it.
|Working with PODs| Working with PODs and rdf is not easy for us, and we had some problems with it.
